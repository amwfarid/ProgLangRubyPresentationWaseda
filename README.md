# Ruby Presentation - HTTP GET Demonstration

This is a small repository for the codes used to demonstrate Ruby's HTTP capabilities.

The scenario is that students will provide their feedback of the presentation by downloading the Ruby code from here, changing the rating and comment variables, then running the code. What shall happen is that their response will be sent to a Google Apps Script (Code also committed for reference) deployed on the cloud that takes their response and adds it to a Google spreadsheet, which can be viewed live here:

This is done as participation to the Programming Languages & Methodologies course at Waseda University, Graduate School of IPS.
